<b>Summary:</b>

<p> 

The GISTIC module identifies regions of the genome that are significantly amplified or deleted across a set of samples.  Each aberration is assigned a G-score that considers the amplitude of the aberration as well as the frequency of its occurrence across samples.  False Discovery Rate q-values are then calculated for the aberrant regions, and regions with q-values below a user-defined threshold are considered significant.  For each significant region, a "peak region" is identified, which is the part of the aberrant region with greatest amplitude and frequency of alteration.  In addition, a "wide peak" is determined using a leave-one-out algorithm to allow for errors in the boundaries in a single sample. The "wide peak" boundaries are more robust for identifying the most likely gene targets in the region. Each significantly aberrant region is also tested to determine whether it results primarily from broad events (longer than half a chromosome arm), focal events, or significant levels of both.  The GISTIC module reports the genomic locations and calculated q-values for the aberrant regions.  It identifies the samples that exhibit each significant amplification or deletion, and it lists genes found in each "wide peak" region.

<h3>Input Files</h3>
<p>

<ol class="infile">
 
<li><b>Segmentation File</b> (-seg) <span>REQUIRED</span>
<p>
The segmentation file contains the segmented data for all the samples identified by GLAD, CBS, or some other segmentation algorithm.  (See GLAD file format in the Genepattern file formats documentation.)  It is a six column, tab-delimited file with an optional first line identifying the columns.  Positions are in base pair units.
<p>
 The column headers are:
<p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>(1)  <i>Sample</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (sample name)</li>
<li>(2)  <i>Chromosome</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (chromosome number)</li>
<li>(3)  <i>Start Position</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (segment start position, in bases)</li>
<li>(4)  <i>End Position</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (segment end position, in bases)</li>
<li>(5)  <i>Num Markers</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (number of markers in segment)</li>
<li>(6)  <i>Seg.CN</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (log2() -1 of copy number)</li>
</ul>

<p> 
<a href="examplefiles/segmentationfile.txt" target="_blank">Example Segmentation File</a>
<p>
</li>

<li><b>Markers File</b> (-mk) <span>OPTIONAL</span>
<p>
The markers file identifies the marker positions used in the original dataset (before segmentation) for array or capture experiments. As of GISTIC release 2.0.23, the markers file is an optional input - if omitted, pseudo markers are generated as uniformly as possible using the maxspace input parameter.  
<p>

The markers file is a three column, tab-delimited file with an optional header.  The column headers are:
<p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>(1)  <i>Marker Name</i></li>
<li>(2)  <i>Chromosome</i></li>
<li>(3)  <i>Marker Position</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(in bases)</li>
</ul>
<p>

<a href="examplefiles/markersfile.txt" target="_blank">Example Markers File</a>
</li>

<li><b>Reference Genome File</b> (-refgene) <span>REQUIRED</span>
<p>
The reference genome file contains information about the location of genes and cytobands on a given build of the genome. Reference genome files are created in MatlabTM and are not viewable with a text editor. The GISTIC 2.0 release has four reference genomes located in the refgenefiles directory: hg16.mat, hg17.mat, hg18.mat, and hg19.mat. 
</li>

<li><b>Array List File</b> (-alf) <span>OPTIONAL</span>
<p>
The array list file is an optional file identifying the subset of samples to be used in the analysis.  It is a one column file with an optional header (array).  The sample identifiers listed in the array list file must match the sample names given in the segmentation file. 
<p>
<a href="examplefiles/arraylistfile.txt" target="_blank">Example Array List File</a>
</li>

<li><b>CNV File</b> (-cnv) <span>OPTIONAL</span>
<p>
There are two options for the file specifying germ line CNVs to be excluded from the analysis.  The first option allows CNVs to be identified by marker name and is platform-specific.  The second option allows the CNVs to be identified by genomic location, which is platform independent but genome-build dependent.
<p>
<u>Option #1</u>:  A two column, tab-delimited file with an optional header row.  The marker names given in this file must match the marker names given in the markers file.  The CNV identifiers are for user use and can be arbitrary.  The column headers are:
<p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>(1)  <i>Marker Name</i></li>
<li>(2)  <i>CNV Identifier</i></li>
<p>
</ul>
<u>Option #2</u>:  A 6 column, tab-delimited file with an optional header row.  The 'CNV Identifier' is for user use and can be arbitrary.  'Narrow Region Start' and 'Narrow Region End' are also not used.  The column headers are:
<p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>(1)  <i>CNV Identifier</i></li>
<li>(2)  <i>Chromosome</i></li>
<li>(3)  <i>Narrow Region Start</i></li>
<li>(4)  <i>Narrow Region End</i></li>
<li>(5)  <i>Wide Region Start</i></li>
<li>(6)  <i>Wide Region End</i></li>
</ul>

<h3>Output Files</h3>
<p>

<ol> 
<li><b>All Lesions File</b> (all_lesions.conf_<i>XX</i>.txt, where <i>XX</i> is the confidence level)
<p>
The all lesions file summarizes the results from the GISTIC run.  It contains data about the significant regions of amplification and deletion as well as which samples are amplified or deleted in each of these regions.  The identified regions are listed down the first column, and the samples are listed across the first row, starting in column 10. 
<p>

<em>Region Data</em>
<p>
Columns 1-9 present the data about the significant regions as follows:
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>(1)  <i>Unique Name:</i> A name assigned to identify the region</li>
<li>(2)  <i>Descriptor:</i> The genomic descriptor of that region.</li>
<li>(3)  <i>Wide Peak Limits:</i> The "wide peak" boundaries most likely to contain the targeted genes.  These are listed in genomic coordinates and marker (or probe) indices.</li>
<li>(4)  <i>Peak Limits:</i> The boundaries of the region of maximal amplification or deletion.</li>
<li>(5)  <i>Region Limits:</i> The boundaries of the entire significant region of amplification or deletion.</li>
<li>(6)  <i>q-values:</i> The q-value of the peak region.</li>
<li>(7)  <i>Residual q-values:</i> The q-value of the peak region after removing ("peeling off") amplifications or deletions that overlap other, more significant peak regions in the same chromosome.</li>
<li>(8)  <i>Broad or Focal:</i> Identifies whether the region reaches significance due primarily to broad events (called "broad"), focal events (called "focal"), or independently significant broad and focal events (called "both").</li>
<li>(9)  <i>Amplitude Threshold:</i> Key giving the meaning of values in the subsequent columns associated with each sample.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>Sample Data</em>
<p>
Each of the analyzed samples is represented in one of the columns following the lesion data (columns 10 through end).  The data contained in these columns varies slightly by section of the file. 
<p>
The first section can be identified by the key given in column 9 – it starts in row 2 and continues until the row that reads "Actual Copy Change Given."  This section contains summarized data for each sample.  A '0' indicates that the copy number of the sample was not amplified or deleted beyond the threshold amount in that peak region.  A '1' indicates that the sample had low-level copy number aberrations (exceeding the low threshold indicated in column 9), and a '2' indicates that the sample had high-level copy number aberrations (exceeding the high threshold indicated in column 9).
<p>
The second section can be identified the rows in which column 9 reads "Actual Copy Change Given."  The second section exactly reproduces the first section, except that here the actual changes in copy number are provided rather than zeroes, ones, and twos.
<p>
The final section is similar to the first section, except that here only broad events are included.  A 1 in the samples columns (columns 10+) indicates that the median copy number of the sample across the entire significant region exceeded the threshold given in column 9.  That is, it indicates whether the sample had a geographically extended event, rather than a focal amplification or deletion covering little more than the peak region.
<p>
</li>

<li><b>Amplification Genes File</b> (amp_genes.conf_<i>XX</i>.txt, where <i>XX</i> is the confidence level)
<p>
The amp genes file contains one column for each amplification peak identified in the GISTIC analysis.  The first four rows are:
<p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>(1) <i>cytoband</i></li>
<li>(2) <i>q-value</i></li>
<li>(3) <i>residual q-value</i></li>
<li>(4) <i>wide peak boundaries</i></li>
</ul>
<p>
These rows identify the lesion in the same way as the all lesions file.
<p>
The remaining rows list the genes contained in each wide peak.  For peaks that contain no genes, the nearest gene is listed in brackets.
<p>
</li>

<li><b>Deletion Genes File</b> (del_genes.conf_<i>XX</i>.txt, where <i>XX</i> is the confidence level)
<p>
The del genes file contains one column for each deletion peak identified in the GISTIC analysis.  The file format for the del genes file is identical to the format for the amp genes file.
<div>
<img border=0 width=582 height=85 src="GISTICDocumentation_standalone_files/image002.png"
</div>
</li>

<li><b>Gistic Scores File</b> (scores.gistic)
<p>
The scores file lists the q-values [presented as -log10(q)], G-scores, average amplitudes among aberrant samples, and frequency of aberration, across the genome for both amplifications and deletions. The scores file is viewable with the Genepattern SNPViewer module and may be imported into the Integrated Genomics Viewer (IGV).
